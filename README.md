# PollenDataset

(C) 2017 Ivan Rodriguez, Rémi Mégret, Edgar Acuña, José Agosto, Tugrul Giray

This image dataset has been created from videos captured at the entrance of a bee colony in June 2017 at the Bee facility of the Gurabo Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of Puerto Rico.

## Repository content

- `images/` contains images for pollen bearing and no pollen bearing honey bees.
    - The prefix of the images names define their class: e.g. `NP1268-15r.jpg` for non-pollen and `P7797-103r.jpg` for pollen bearing bees. The numbers correspond to frame and item number respectively, you need to be careful that they are not numbered sequentially. 
  
- `Read-skimage.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for simple script to load the data and create the dataset using `skimage` library.
